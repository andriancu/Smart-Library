project details: Masters Degree Project, not maintained anymore, was just a PoC.

This software platform uses ElasticSearch's powerfull search engines in order to process and compare text documents.

There are two main methods of processing text data: LDA and TextEmbeddings.

For the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), we are using a locally trained model on BBC news articles data.
The text embeddings is using tensorflow pre-trained embeddings downloaded from the hub (Google API).

The ElasticSearch index settings are present in cluster/ folder for each processing type.

The pre-trained LDA models present in the models/ folder cannot be decoded with pickle in a different machine environment, so in case
an error pops up, a new model has to be trained.
